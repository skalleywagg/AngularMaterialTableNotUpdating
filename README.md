# My Failed Attempt to Use an Angular Material Table in an Electron App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.0.

## Running

Use `npm run-script electron` and after the window and dev console appear, you can use the button at the top to populate the table.  A few seconds later, the data comes back from the main process and updates the data.  You'll notice the BrowserWindow does not update until you click on it or click on another window like the dev console.
